# Nerva Sketch (Future)

Optional minimal GUI wrapper for Nerva.

**Status**: Not yet implemented. TUI shell (apps/shell) is the MVP focus.

## Vision

- Electron-based lightweight window
- Embedded terminal for shell
- Pure keyboard navigation
- Minimal chrome

## Deferred to Post-MVP

This will be implemented after the shell TUI is stable and feature-complete.
